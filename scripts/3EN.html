			<h1>The main dilemma</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="ievads">
			<p id="ievads">Every morning you have to stand at the crossroads of choice. Catching a bus is only part of the logistics process that enables access to the University. A very big dilemma arises at the moment when youre leaving the house. You have to try and understand exactly which public transportation route to take. In my district – Mežciems - there are several public transport routes, which more or less allow to get to the same destinations. All these routes are concentrated in the two main streets of Mežciems, each of which surrounds Mežciems on its own side. It might seem that these main border streets are far from each other, but taking the time, it is possible to find out that walking straight through Mežciems, you can get from each to the other after a 4/5 minute walk. Every morning in my arsenal there are 7 public transport routes - two buses, two trolleybuses and three minibuses, each varying slightly in its chosen route, but with the possibility to get to the center. They are mostly grouped into two parts - getting off at the Esplanade park or getting off at the Central station. Both destinations allow access to Raina Boulevard 19 with a 5-minute walk. </p>
