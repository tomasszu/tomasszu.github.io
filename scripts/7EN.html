			<p id="ievads">The main, the first and to this day – the administration building for the Latvian University. The building where the history of this university began, the beginning of my and many other students' higher education, and the building where my daily journey to the university comes to an end. Running up the wide stairs and opening the large and heavy doors in the form of an arch, I conclude my small morning trip to class. Getting closer to the building you can take a deep breath, knowing that you are practically present if there was any running to make it on time. Or do the exact opposite - sigh, for the threat of having to learn and accumulate new information is coming closer once again. No matter what the situation outside the university premises, when you enter the building and close the unnecessarily heavy and massive door behind you, you feel that you are entering another - academic world. When leaving outerwear in the wardrobe, you have probably already met a classmate and, voluntarily or not so much, you will continue your journey to the audience together to supplement the ranks of Latvian bachelors. </p>
