			<p id="ievads">The road to the university for me is extremely rich in terms of sights. As you can see in the title picture, driving by you can see some of Riga's tourist attractions. This is not a surprise, because when going to the university from Mežciems, you get to do it along either Brīvības or Čaka streets, which are one of the richest streets culturally and historically Latvia has to offer. They start from the old suburbs of Riga - Jugla, Teika, Grizinkalns, to the historical centre. There are many buildings to be seen, such as the KGB Corner House, the Daile Theater, the Gertrude Church, many Art Nouveau and 19th-century buildings. Parks and shops are visible. Bridges are traversed and railway tracks are crossed. Driving along Brīvības or Čaka streets, the views on the centre side are similar - late 19th and early 20th century houses, but Čaka street ends by the station square with the central station and the surrounding buildings, which give a slightly different mood in the morning than the Brīvības street routes - where the journey ends in the embrace of Art Nouveau buildings. </p>
